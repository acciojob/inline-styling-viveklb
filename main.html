			<h2>Flowers photos</h2>
			<p>Flowers are the reproductive, often colorful, structures of flowering plants (angiosperms) that produce seeds via pollination. They typically feature petals, sepals, and reproductive parts (stamens/pistils) on a stem. Beyond reproduction, flowers are vital for ecosystems, provide food for pollinators, and are used for decoration, medicine, and scent.</p>
